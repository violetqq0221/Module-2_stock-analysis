# Overview of Project
In this project, we'll refactoring the VBA code for stockmarket database in 2017 and 2018. 
After refactoring and editing the code, try to make the VBA run more efficiently and easier to understand and use. 
# Results

 In 2017: 
   * The code took 0.4420166 seconds for run it.

# summary
* Although refactoring code doesn't add features or any function in a system,  in genal refactoring can make the code easier to understnad and read becasue the the goal is to simplify the code. However without clear statements, it can be risky to refactore the code.People may need to spend extra work to debug the code. 
* For this challeng, the dataset is small, after refactoring code, both years(2017 and 2018) runtime down to ~ 0.44 second. However, we need to be aware to refactoring code to  the larger daatbase.
